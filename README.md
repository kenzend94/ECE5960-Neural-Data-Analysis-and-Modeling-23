# Mathematical Tools for Neural Data Analysis and Modeling

## Course Overview

Mathematical tools for neural data analysis and modeling. The course covers a set of mathematical and statistical methods that are fundamental for analyzing and modeling neural/cognitive data and neural signal and information processing, which are practiced through extensive computational exercises. The tentative topics include linear algebra, least-squares regression, eigen-analysis and PCA, linear shift-invariant systems, convolution, Fourier transforms, Nyquist sampling, basics of probability and statistics, hypothesis testing, model comparison, bootstrapping, estimation and decision theory, signal detection theory, classification, linear discriminants, clustering, simple models of neural spike generation, white noise (reverse-correlation) analysis, and if time permits information theory, generalized linear models. The course is intended for students from quantitative backgrounds, including engineering, math, statistics, computer science, physics, neuroscience, psychology.
